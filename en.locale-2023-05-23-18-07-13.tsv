133	143	CHIRP_POLICY	DoubleSentences	1	Are the longer prison sentences really helping? IMHO That is just fixing the symptom, not the cause.

133	153	CHIRP_POLICY	Financial	1	These new #FinancialOffice buildings look luxuriant!			
133	153	CHIRP_POLICY	Financial	2	I feel like ever since these #FinancialOffice buildings started appearing I started to feel unhappier. Is it just me?			
133	153	CHIRP_POLICY	Financial	3	I know nothing about stock markets but the new financial buildings look amazing!

133	156	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	1	I liked it nice and cool, why does the city want my house to have extra insulation? #coolwayoflife #extrainsulation			
133	156	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	2	Extra insulation saves me so much money! No more heat leaking outside, now everything stays where it should #extrainsulation

133	157	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	1	Saving electricity is good for the city! Everyone should use heating to get warm! #noelectricity			
133	157	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	2	Isn't there plenty of electricity left over now that I can't use it for heating? Isn't that dangerous? #noelectricity			
133	157	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	3	I'm liking the heating service. No more wasted electricity! #noelectricity			
133	157	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	4	It's always too hot in houses heated with heating service. I want more electricity for heating! #noelectricity

133	158	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	1	Oh no, what if I want to heat my house with something else than electricity? #onlyelectricity			
133	158	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	2	I like the pure, clean heat produced by electricity. Just my kind of thing! #onlyelectricity			
133	158	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	3	I'd like my heat to come from a Geo Thermal Plant. Pretty please? #onlyelectricity			
133	158	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	4	Simple and fast, I like using electricity for heat! So what if it costs a bit more #onlyelectricity			
133	159	CHIRP_POLICY	LightningRods	0	I simply think they are ugly! Please, no more #lightningrods

133	160	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	0	What a waste! I think the emergency services could use ground vehicles, helicopters are too noisy! #helicopterpriority			
133	160	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	1	I don't like helicopters, they are so noisy! Go back to using ground vehicles! #helicopterpriority			
133	160	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	2	No more streering to the sidewalk to give way to fire trucks, I love the helicopters! #helicopterpriority			
133	160	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	3	I think the traffic flows so much smoother now that we don't have emergency vehicles on the streets. And helicopters are so much faster! #helicopterpriority			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	0	I'm so glad I live in the VIP area, I couldn't sleep at night if I didn't have a reserved spot in the shelter! #VIParea			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	1	I'm not a VIP, what if I can't fit in the shelter if a disaster hits? I'm scared! #VIParea			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	2	A reserved seat at the shelter? Yes please! #VIParea			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	3	I'm worried that everyone might not fit into the shelter with the VIP spots. #VIParea			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	4	Getting to shelters is so much easier when people have reserved spots! #VIParea			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	0	I think I hear someone beneath the cellar floor. Did you miss something before rebuilding? #fastrecovery			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	1	Thanks to #fastrecovery I'll have a new home in no time! Living in the shelter got super boring really fast.			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	2	Oh no, I don't think my hamster was found after the disaster, and when I went to look, there was already a new house on the lot! #fastrecovery #savethehamster			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	3	I hate seeing destroyed buildings, they just cramp up the city feng shui. Thanks for #fastrecovery			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	4	Look at those new buildings, so shiny and they were built so fast! #fastrecovery			
133	163	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	0	As an urban explorer, I simply love that the city has preserved some of the ruins. They are exciting! #norebuild			
133	163	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	1	The ruins are great for parkour! Thanks for saving some! #norebuild			
133	163	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	2	Anyone up for a walk in the ruins? #norebuild			
133	163	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	3	I used to have a lovely view from my window, but now it's just ruins! #norebuild			
133	163	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	4	No more ruins! Can't we have shiny new things in the place of those ugly ruins, please? #norebuild

133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	4	Once again, I’m searching for a ferry to take me to my destination #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	5	Can’t wait to board a ferry again! #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	6	Ferries are my number one way of getting around the city! #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	7	Looking for a ferry home! #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	8	Do we have any new ferry lines? I’d like to try one! #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	9	Ferries are just so much more comfy to travel in than any other public transport! #preferferries			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	10	I would so much rather go by bus than with a ferry. But ferries are what I need right now! #preferferries #weirdsensations			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	0	Today I learned things by looking at a blimp #whowouldhaveguessed #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	1	Did you see that blimp? I never knew that before! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	2	It used to be so easy to decide what to get from the supermarket by looking at blimps, but now I can’t do that anymore. Boo! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	3	Educational posters are so boring! Bring back the adverts! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	4	Where are the nice, colourful advertisements? #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	5	I have learned so many new things thanks to the blimps! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	6	Live and learn. Just look at that thing in the sky, even that is teaching us! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	7	Educational posters? On blimps? Now I’ve seen everything #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	8	I love the educational posters on blimps, children can learn even when traveling to school and back! #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	9	If only I could see the educational posters also when riding a blimp! #dreamer #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	10	I want to place an advert on a blimp but these educational posters are taking up all the space! #annoyed #educationalblimps			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	0	The tickets are so expensive! I might be better off just buying my own car. #carshopping #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	1	I feel the ticket prices are a bit high, but it’s justified. The system is wonderful! #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	2	I don’t mind paying a high price for public transport tickets, it’s not like I’m poor! #cashmoney #plentyofdough #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	3	I have plenty of money, right? So I can pay the ticket prices. After that I don’t have plenty of money #emptypockets #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	4	It’s so expensive to use the public transport! I have to walk tomorrow! #myownway #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	5	I really like the public transport network. I have no problem with the prices, but I know some do! #itsokay #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	6	Now that I have seen the public transport system, the ticket price doesn’t seem bad at all! #bestsystem #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	7	I’m just loving the public transport system in this city, never mind the ticket prices! #lovinit #highticketprices			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	8	That’s way too much for a ticket! I’d rather walk! #toohigh #highticketprices

133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	10	I love our public transport system! I’d use it no matter the price! #iloveit #highticketprices			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	0	Can I recycle my unused plastic bags too? I have many plastic bags full of them. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	1	What do they do with all the #recycled #plastic ? 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	2	I heard that if you do not recycle your plastic waste, #penguins will die. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	3	About the time we had better #plastic #recycling system in the city. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	4	In the U.S. alone, 2,5 million #plastic bottles are thrown out every hour! #Recycle and #Reuse. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	5	Great news: Local #businesses join the plastic #recycling effort 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	6	You can probably #recycle more than you think. Just pay attention to what you put in the #trash. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	7	#plastic #pollution is getting worse, we must save the Earth. #makeEarthgreatagain			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	8	We are filling our oceans and lands with plastics. #recycle !			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	9	We wouldn't have to recycle our #plastic bags, bottles, etc if we ceased to manufacture them. Why won't we?			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	10	Change your #plasticbottle into a refillable bottle and save a lot of plastic waste. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	0	No more stinky smoke from cars! At least not so much anyway :) #Freshair #ipreferoxygen			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	1	IMHO it's great how our city is showing great example by banning the combustion engines. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	2	About the time we had better #plastic #recycling system in the city. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	3	Hey, where have all the cars gone? It's so calm here. Love it! 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	4	Every car that is not polluting the atmosphere is a good car. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	5	Oh nice. I just bought a new #car and now I can't use it? Really? #engineban			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	6	This #combustion #engine #ban will kill all the businesses in the area. I'm sure about it. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	7	I find this new combustion engine ban a very welcome reform. People should walk more anyway. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	8	Yes! Great to see that the city officials are all for the greener future. Good job! #combustionengineban			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	9	Global warming is fake news, so these kind of bans make no sense #makeourcitygreatagain			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	10	I don't mind having less #traffic and more room for #bicycles :D #combustionengineban			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	0	Hey, where's all the traffic noise gone! #electric #cars are so silent it's amazing.			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	1	Electric cars are dangerous as people cannot hear the electric cars coming! Think about that.			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	2	Was there a new Edison #electriccar model coming out this year? 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	3	Have you noticed the new recharge stations for electric cars? #EVSE			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	4	They are offering free battery switch service for this week. #electriccars			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	5	I didn't know electric cars are as fast as they are :o 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	6	Electric or hybrid? What's your opinion? #electriccars			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	7	I've been very satisfied with the new electric car. I was a bit biased, but now I wouldn't change back to a traditional car. 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	8	Is it possible to modify your old car into an #electriccar or #hybrid? I wouldn't want to change my trusty old car. It has served me 30 years already.			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	9	Electric cars - what are they good for? Meh. #monstertrucks4ever			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	10	A bold move from our city to move away from the conventional fossil #fuelvehicles. #ElectricCars are the future!

133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	1	Has anyone else noticed that it doesn't smell so funny here anymore. #greenfuture			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	2	Reducing industrial waste is the right choice. Makes living in the city much nicer too. 			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	3	let me tell ya: I know what's it like to work in a factory. This waste filtering thing is good for the workers too. 			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	4	Is this again some kind of #globalwarming #scheme? They are just trying to sell those expensive filters for everyone. 			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	5	How do the #industrial #waste #filters work? Do they plug those in the waste pipes and that's it?			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	6	I'm thinking if it would be possible to still filter the filtered waste...? #justwondering			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	7	Awesome! This is great news. Less pollution = Green revolution #industrial #waste #filtering			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	8	Enforcing the industrial waste regulations was a good move - then again, what other choice do we have #pollution #globalwarming			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	9	I will happily pay some extra taxes, if we can get the industrial waste levels down.			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	10	Has anybody thought how must it produces waste to make those industrial waste filters? yeah, let that sink in for a bit... #theuglytruth #globalwarminghoax #flatearthfacts			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	0	Good bye monopoly of the energy companies! Self-sufficient houses are going to change the game. #offthegrid			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	1	#Ecological does not equal uneconomical. Many of the modern #ecofriendly solutions are comfortable and relatively affordable. 			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	2	I love the new self-sufficient buildings!			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	3	Eco this and eco that. What's the whole fuss about some global warming? Same weather every year where I live. #ecocritical #localwarming			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	4	Decentralizing energy production and waste management should have more support. That is the solution of future anyway. 			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	5	If you want to live like the pioneers, go live in the woods, hippies! 			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	6	Self-sufficient… more like in-sufficient for me XD IMHO #powerconsumer #supercharged #singleservingsonly			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	7	I think everyone should handle their own power, water and waste so they would learn to regulate their usage better. #responsibleliving			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	8	Just to be clear: people lived without electricity and had outhouses longtime ago, but self-sufficient houses are a totally different thing.			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	9	Where to buy solar panels with best value for the money? Any #protip s? 			
133	171	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	10	Do you need a permit to set up a personal wind turbine? #SelfSufficient #DIY #homeupgrade 			
133	172	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	0	Great to have locally produced food! #LocalProduce			
133	172	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	1	Oh yeah! Locally and #organicallygrown carrots and eggs!

133	172	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	3	Always ready to support local #ecofriendly #entrepreneurs			
133	172	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	4	The organically grown food products are a bit more expensive, but they're also much healthier.

133	210	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	6	I would much rather see young people read books than play football. Why don't we spend money on that? #subsidizedyouth #football

133	212	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	5	Why are we wasting money on extra police on match days? I think homeless sloths are much more in need of help than football fans! #matchsecurity #football			
133	212	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	6	Football fans should take better care of their belongings and keep their heads cool! No extra police would be needed! #matchsecurity #football			
133	212	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	7	Do we really need more police on match days? Maybe that money could be better spent on others things, like libraries #matchsecurity #football

Educated workers prefer vacancies that match their education, but will settle for a lower level job eventually, if need be. Filling low level vacancies in a city with a highly educated population can take a while.\n\nWhen placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
4944	4939	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewFireSafety	0	Fires can occur in your city. The fire department building closest to the fire sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected the areas of the city are.			
4944	4940	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewGarbage	0	To collect garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant.

When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
4944	4941	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHealth	0	To keep citizens healthy, make sure they have access to enough healthcare facilities via good road connections.

Ambulances pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars.\n\nAll citizens age and will eventually perish of old age regardless of their health. Deathcare buildings send out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve effectively.\n\nChild Health Centre increases the birth rate within the building's radius and offers health services to minors. Eldercare treats the elderly, increasing and varying the citizen lifespan within the building radius. \n			
4944	4942	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewCrime	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime in control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city.
