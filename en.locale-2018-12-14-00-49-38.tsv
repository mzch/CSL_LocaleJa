132	145	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	1	I liked it nice and cool, why does the city want my house to have extra insulation? #coolwayoflife #extrainsulation			
132	145	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	2	Extra insulation saves me so much money! No more heat leaking outside, now everything stays where it should #extrainsulation			
132	145	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	3	I feel so hot in buildings with extra insulation! #toohottohandle #extrainsulation			
132	145	CHIRP_POLICY	ExtraInsulation	4	I bet the city saves plenty of energy with extra insulation. Even my grumpy neighbor had to install some. #extrainsulation

132	146	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	1	Saving electricity is good for the city! Everyone should use heating to get warm! #noelectricity			
132	146	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	2	Isn't there plenty of electricity left over now that I can't use it for heating? Isn't that dangerous? #noelectricity			
132	146	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	3	I'm liking the heating service. No more wasted electricity! #noelectricity			
132	146	CHIRP_POLICY	NoElectricity	4	It's always too hot in houses heated with heating service. I want more electricity for heating! #noelectricity			
132	147	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	0	All of that hassle with the heating services is wasted effort, pure electricity works just as well #onlyelectricity			
132	147	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	1	Oh no, what if I want to heat my house with something else than electricity? #onlyelectricity			
132	147	CHIRP_POLICY	OnlyElectricity	2	I like the pure, clean heat produced by electricity. Just my kind of thing! #onlyelectricity

132	149	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	0	What a waste! I think the emergency services could use ground vehicles, helicopters are too noisy! #helicopterpriority			
132	149	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	1	I don't like helicopters, they are so noisy! Go back to using ground vehicles! #helicopterpriority			
132	149	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	2	No more streering to the sidewalk to give way to fire trucks, I love the helicopters! #helicopterpriority			
132	149	CHIRP_POLICY	HelicopterPriority	3	I think the traffic flows so much smoother now that we don't have emergency vehicles on the streets. And helicopters are so much faster! #helicopterpriority			
132	150	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	0	I'm so glad I live in the VIP area, I couldn't sleep at night if I didn't have a reserved spot in the shelter! #VIParea			
132	150	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	1	I'm not a VIP, what if I can't fit in the shelter if a disaster hits? I'm scared! #VIParea			
132	150	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	2	A reserved seat at the shelter? Yes please! #VIParea			
132	150	CHIRP_POLICY	VIPArea	3	I'm worried that everyone might not fit into the shelter with the VIP spots. #VIParea

132	151	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	1	Thanks to #fastrecovery I'll have a new home in no time! Living in the shelter got super boring really fast.			
132	151	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	2	Oh no, I don't think my hamster was found after the disaster, and when I went to look, there was already a new house on the lot! #fastrecovery #savethehamster			
132	151	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	3	I hate seeing destroyed buildings, they just cramp up the city feng shui. Thanks for #fastrecovery			
132	151	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	4	Look at those new buildings, so shiny and they were built so fast! #fastrecovery			
132	152	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	0	As an urban explorer, I simply love that the city has preserved some of the ruins. They are exciting! #norebuild			
132	152	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	1	The ruins are great for parkour! Thanks for saving some! #norebuild			
132	152	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	2	Anyone up for a walk in the ruins? #norebuild

132	153	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	7	Looking for a ferry home! #preferferries			
132	153	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	8	Do we have any new ferry lines? I’d like to try one! #preferferries			
132	153	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	9	Ferries are just so much more comfy to travel in than any other public transport! #preferferries			
132	153	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferFerries	10	I would so much rather go by bus than with a ferry. But ferries are what I need right now! #preferferries #weirdsensations

132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	1	Did you see that blimp? I never knew that before! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	2	It used to be so easy to decide what to get from the supermarket by looking at blimps, but now I can’t do that anymore. Boo! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	3	Educational posters are so boring! Bring back the adverts! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	4	Where are the nice, colourful advertisements? #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	5	I have learned so many new things thanks to the blimps! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	6	Live and learn. Just look at that thing in the sky, even that is teaching us! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	7	Educational posters? On blimps? Now I’ve seen everything #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	8	I love the educational posters on blimps, children can learn even when traveling to school and back! #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	9	If only I could see the educational posters also when riding a blimp! #dreamer #educationalblimps			
132	154	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	10	I want to place an advert on a blimp but these educational posters are taking up all the space! #annoyed #educationalblimps			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	0	The tickets are so expensive! I might be better off just buying my own car. #carshopping #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	1	I feel the ticket prices are a bit high, but it’s justified. The system is wonderful! #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	2	I don’t mind paying a high price for public transport tickets, it’s not like I’m poor! #cashmoney #plentyofdough #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	3	I have plenty of money, right? So I can pay the ticket prices. After that I don’t have plenty of money #emptypockets #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	4	It’s so expensive to use the public transport! I have to walk tomorrow! #myownway #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	5	I really like the public transport network. I have no problem with the prices, but I know some do! #itsokay #highticketprices			
132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	6	Now that I have seen the public transport system, the ticket price doesn’t seem bad at all! #bestsystem #highticketprices

132	155	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	8	That’s way too much for a ticket! I’d rather walk! #toohigh #highticketprices

132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	0	Can I recycle my unused plastic bags too? I have many plastic bags full of them. 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	1	What do they do with all the #recycled #plastic ? 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	2	I heard that if you do not recycle your plastic waste, #penguins will die. 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	3	About the time we had better #plastic #recycling system in the city. 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	4	In the U.S. alone, 2,5 million #plastic bottles are thrown out every hour! #Recycle and #Reuse. 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	5	Great news: Local #businesses join the plastic #recycling effort 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	6	You can probably #recycle more than you think. Just pay attention to what you put in the #trash. 			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	7	#plastic #pollution is getting worse, we must save the Earth. #makeEarthgreatagain			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	8	We are filling our oceans and lands with plastics. #recycle !			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	9	We wouldn't have to recycle our #plastic bags, bottles, etc if we ceased to manufacture them. Why won't we?			
132	156	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	10	Change your #plasticbottle into a refillable bottle and save a lot of plastic waste. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	0	No more stinky smoke from cars! At least not so much anyway :) #Freshair #ipreferoxygen			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	1	IMHO it's great how our city is showing great example by banning the combustion engines. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	2	About the time we had better #plastic #recycling system in the city. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	3	Hey, where have all the cars gone? It's so calm here. Love it! 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	4	Every car that is not polluting the atmosphere is a good car. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	5	Oh nice. I just bought a new #car and now I can't use it? Really? #engineban			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	6	This #combustion #engine #ban will kill all the businesses in the area. I'm sure about it. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	7	I find this new combustion engine ban a very welcome reform. People should walk more anyway. 			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	8	Yes! Great to see that the city officials are all for the greener future. Good job! #combustionengineban			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	9	Global warming is fake news, so these kind of bans make no sense #makeourcitygreatagain			
132	157	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	10	I don't mind having less #traffic and more room for #bicycles :D #combustionengineban			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	0	Hey, where's all the traffic noise gone! #electric #cars are so silent it's amazing.			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	1	Electric cars are dangerous as people cannot hear the electric cars coming! Think about that.			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	2	Was there a new Edison #electriccar model coming out this year? 			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	3	Have you noticed the new recharge stations for electric cars? #EVSE			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	4	They are offering free battery switch service for this week. #electriccars			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	5	I didn't know electric cars are as fast as they are :o 			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	6	Electric or hybrid? What's your opinion? #electriccars			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	7	I've been very satisfied with the new electric car. I was a bit biased, but now I wouldn't change back to a traditional car. 			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	8	Is it possible to modify your old car into an #electriccar or #hybrid? I wouldn't want to change my trusty old car. It has served me 30 years already.			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	9	Electric cars - what are they good for? Meh. #monstertrucks4ever			
132	158	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	10	A bold move from our city to move away from the conventional fossil #fuelvehicles. #ElectricCars are the future!

132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	2	Reducing industrial waste is the right choice. Makes living in the city much nicer too. 			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	3	let me tell ya: I know what's it like to work in a factory. This waste filtering thing is good for the workers too. 			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	4	Is this again some kind of #globalwarming #scheme? They are just trying to sell those expensive filters for everyone. 			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	5	How do the #industrial #waste #filters work? Do they plug those in the waste pipes and that's it?			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	6	I'm thinking if it would be possible to still filter the filtered waste...? #justwondering			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	7	Awesome! This is great news. Less pollution = Green revolution #industrial #waste #filtering			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	8	Enforcing the industrial waste regulations was a good move - then again, what other choice do we have #pollution #globalwarming			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	9	I will happily pay some extra taxes, if we can get the industrial waste levels down.			
132	159	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	10	Has anybody thought how must it produces waste to make those industrial waste filters? yeah, let that sink in for a bit... #theuglytruth #globalwarminghoax #flatearthfacts			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	0	Good bye monopoly of the energy companies! Self-sufficient houses are going to change the game. #offthegrid			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	1	#Ecological does not equal uneconomical. Many of the modern #ecofriendly solutions are comfortable and relatively affordable. 			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	2	I love the new self-sufficient buildings!			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	3	Eco this and eco that. What's the whole fuss about some global warming? Same weather every year where I live. #ecocritical #localwarming			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	4	Decentralizing energy production and waste management should have more support. That is the solution of future anyway. 			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	5	If you want to live like the pioneers, go live in the woods, hippies! 			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	6	Self-sufficient… more like in-sufficient for me XD IMHO #powerconsumer #supercharged #singleservingsonly			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	7	I think everyone should handle their own power, water and waste so they would learn to regulate their usage better. #responsibleliving			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	8	Just to be clear: people lived without electricity and had outhouses longtime ago, but self-sufficient houses are a totally different thing.			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	9	Where to buy solar panels with best value for the money? Any #protip s? 			
132	160	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	10	Do you need a permit to set up a personal wind turbine? #SelfSufficient #DIY #homeupgrade

132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	3	Always ready to support local #ecofriendly #entrepreneurs			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	4	The organically grown food products are a bit more expensive, but they're also much healthier.			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	5	Anyone doing local meat products? 			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	6	Who regulates how the organic foods are produced? #OrganicFoods			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	7	Do they allow pesticides in organic farming? 			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	8	This is organic food thing is again one of those hippie crazes. It will pass. 			
132	161	CHIRP_POLICY	Organic	9	Is there a law that forbids having chickens in urban areas?

132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	1	So we are having our own local center of innovative technologies. Lots of new apps coming I guess :D			
132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	2	I hope the new IT cluster will bring more businesses to our city.			
132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	3	Everything is nowadays about apps and gadgets. What about good old steel mills and car factories? 			
132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	4	Investors coming to town! #ITCluster

132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	8	For sure the new #Itcluster #hightech businesses will draw in new professionals. 			
132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	9	Completely superficial changes like Chirper's new hats are what #ITCluster experts mean when they say innovation.			
132	162	CHIRP_POLICY	Hightech	10	These #Itcluster nerds really know how to party!

132	163	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferParks	3	The kids demand to go to the park, what can I do? #PreferParks			
132	163	CHIRP_POLICY	PreferParks	4	I wish we had even more parks, I feel like I've seen them all #PreferParks

132	164	CHIRP_POLICY	ParkMaintenanceBoost	2	This is one well cared-for park! #ParkMaintenanceBoost			
132	164	CHIRP_POLICY	ParkMaintenanceBoost	3	The Park Maintenance workers always seem so busy #ParkMaintenanceBoost

To clear the snow, you need Snow Dumps that send out snow plows. Roads can have different amount of snow on them, depending on when they were plowed and how much it has snowed.			
3577	3542	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEscapeRoutes	0	Escape routes adjust Shelter coverage areas, so you can assign citizens to take shelter far away from where they live. Click on a Shelter to edit its escape route.			
3577	3543	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewRadio	0	Having good radio coverage gives a small happiness boost from being able to listen to the radio, but more importantly makes sure that citizens are aware of approaching disasters and are more likely to evacuate when called to.			
3577	3544	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDestruction	0	View destroyed buildings and buildings ready for rebuilding. If there's a Disaster Response Unit in the city, any destroyed buildings are tended to and the unit searches for survivors. After they have visited the lot, the rubble is ready for rebuilding and will be automatically used when the city needs more of the zoned type. City service buildings are not automatically rebuilt but need to be manually replaced. You can always bulldoze rubble.			
3577	3545	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDisasterDetection	0	The disaster info view is available if the city has an early warning system for the disaster threatening the city. The info view shows the coverage of early warning systems and as estimate of where the disaster will hit, if the area to be stricken is within the range of the early warning systems.

When the info view is open, click on a citizen, vehicle, building or road to see routes. \n\nYou can also adjust intersection rules and traffic lights. Zoom in on and intersection to see yield options and toggle traffic lights on and off. Only intersections with no traffic lights can have yield rules. Note that yield signs cannot be placed on road next to each other.\n			
3577	3547	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTrafficRoutes	0	Click on any piece of road, vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist or building to show routes. With vehicles and pedestrians, you see the route they are currently taking. For buildings and road pieces, the routes taken through or to and from the item are shown. This information can help you identify where vehicles at a traffic jam are coming from, or where you should build a public transport line to help pedestrians get to their destination faster. \n\nTo adjust right of way and traffic lights, zoom into an intersection. An intersection with traffic lights cannot have right of way rules, but intersections with no lights can work a lot smoother with some right of way rules in place.\n\nWith Adjust Road tab selected you can alter what is considered to be one road.\n			
3577	3548	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTours	0	Sightseeing Bus and Walking Tours are guided tours that can affect which locations the tourists visit regularly in the city. Places of interest are highlighted in the Info View and tours that pass through highly attractive or entertaining places of interest usually draw more tourists.\n\nDetails of the tour lines can be examined in the Lines Overview.\n			
3577	3549	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewParkMaintenance	0	Park Maintenance service boosts the entertainment effect of parks, plazas and park areas. Parks work normally without maintenance. Boost fades with time.			
3577	3550	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTourism	0	Tourists use the outside connections to visit the city and its various attractions and points of interest.

Citizens will gain boost to their well-being if the mail is handled by the Post Office city service. \n\nMail is transported in mail trucks to and from Outside Connections to Post Offices or to a Post Sorting Facility if one is available. Post Sorting Facilities handle long distance mail and distribute it between the local Post Offices.\n\nNot taking care of this need will result in decreased citizen Well-Being to default level.\n			
3577	3552	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewIndustry	0	Industry Areas can be created by using Industry Area tool. The type of the Main Building determines what kind of goods area produces. Industry Areas need raw materials, like Oil or Crops, to operate. Raw materials can either be imported or gathered locally by Extractors. Thanks to new storage spaces, Industry Areas can fully operate on imported raw materials only.\n\nRaw materials can be exported, sold to specialized zoned industry or used by Processing buildings. Processing buildings in turn produce special goods, which can be either exported, sold to non-specialized zoned industry or used by Unique Factories.\n\nUnique Factories produce Luxury Goods, which can be exported or sold to commercial zones.\n			
3577	393	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Industry	0	Industry Areas can be created by using Industry Area tool. The type of the Main Building determines what kind of goods area produces. Industry Areas need raw materials, like Oil or Crops, to operate. Raw materials can either be imported or gathered locally by Extractors. Thanks to new storage spaces, Industry Areas can fully operate on imported raw materials only.\n\nRaw materials can be exported, sold to specialized zoned industry or used by Processing buildings.

3577	2630	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Landscaping	0	With the landscaping tools, you can lower or elevate terrain, smooth it out or create new hills. When you lower terrain, you will gain soil. When elevating terrain, the same soil is placed on the map. To see how much soil you have, check "Soil available".\n\nWater structures allow you to build canals, quays and flood walls. Canals can be used for beautification or moving water. Use flood walls to keep water in the canal if flooding occurs often. If your canal is not getting any water, try using a deeper canal. You can upgrade canals to be deeper or shallower. Quays are used on water front to finish the shoreline nicely. You can place shoreline buildings on top of quay.\n\nTrees, rocks and cliffs can be placed on the map for added flavor and aesthetical purposes. Trees also reduce Noise Pollution in their vicinity.\n			
3577	2194	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Roads	0	Roads need to be built to provide zones for buildings and city services. Larger roads allow faster travel and greater amounts of traffic. Roads with decoration produce less noise pollution. Use PageUp and PageDown to build elevated roads or tunnels. Draw a road over water to build a bridge. \n\nTo change the road’s type, try the upgrading tool: choose a road type and click on an existing road. Click on a one-way road with secondary mouse button to change its direction. Use upgrade tool to fix destroyed roads.\n\nToll Booths must be connected to road in order to operate. All traffic driving through the toll must slow down at the booths and pay a fee to pass the toll. Fare price can be adjusted from Toll Booth building info panel.\n			
3577	2637	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Zoning	0	Zones determine what kinds of buildings will spawn to the areas next to the roads. Areas indicated by a grey grid next to roads can be zoned using zoning tools.  \n\nThere are four different tools for zoning: Fill, Marquee and Small and Large Brush. Zone an area by clicking the primary mouse button on it. Hold down the button to adjust the square marquee size or continuously paint with a brush. \n\nResidential zones provide housing for the citizens. Commercial zones offer shopping and leisure opportunities for the citizens and tourists. Industry and office zones provide jobs for the citizens and produce goods for the commercial zones to sell.\n			
3577	2638	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	District	0	Paint the part of the city you want to become a district. New districts will be named automatically, but can be renamed later by clicking the district's name in its info window. Apply a special policy by selecting it and clicking on the district. Remove districts by painting areas with the secondary mouse button held down. Click on district name to apply policies.\n\nDistrict specializations allow buildings to be replaced by specialized industrial and commercial facilities. Specialized buildings can benefit from different natural resources or focus on tourism, for example. Specialized industrial and commercial zones are usually more effective in comparison to regular industrial or commercial buildings, but focusing has its downsides that can range from elevated pollutant emissions to increased water consumption.\n			
3577	2464	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Electricity	0	Power plants produce electricity for all your modern city's needs. Electricity will move from building to building over short distances, but to transfer electricity over greater distances, you will need to build Power Lines. \n\nWhen placing Power Lines, you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings as a light blue area. Connect these areas with Power Lines to move electricity between them. Power plants produce ground and/or noise pollution. \n\nWhen placing a power plant, the circular area around it tells you how far the pollution spreads.\n			
3577	2631	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	WaterAndSewage	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes. Draw the water pipes under your city to provide buildings with a water and a sewer system. Note that the water pumps and drains need electricity to work. Water Tanks store excess water and supply the city automatically when demand exceeds production.\n\nMake sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water.\n\nDuring the winter, heating is required. Upgraded water pipes carry heat to buildings.\n			
3577	2463	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Garbage	0	To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. \n\nWaste management produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes ground pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. Landfill sites and incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash. Make sure they can get around the city easily.\n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	2632	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Healthcare	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars. Helicopters can reach destinations without road access and are not affected by traffic jams.  \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	2635	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	FireDepartment	0	Fires can occur in your city. To prevent buildings from being destroyed by fire, you need to have a properly equipped fire department in your city. \n\nIn case of fire, the closest fire department building sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected areas in the city are. Depending on the size of the fire, multiple fire engines can be dispatched to put it out.\n\nHelicopters can reach destinations with no road access, and are the only way to extinguish forest fires. Build Firewatch Towers to spot forest fires early.\n			
3577	2622	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Police	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime under control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city, so that patrol cars can respond to calls quickly. Police Helicopters patrol areas, but need ground vehicles to catch criminals.\n\nPolice patrols decrease the crime rate. High unemployment and low education increase the crime rate. \n			
3577	2636	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Government	0	The presence of local government allows for customization of taxes, budget and loans in the city.			
3577	2633	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Education	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university if one is available. Education is complete when a citizen ends their age phase while enlisted in a school, so educating your population takes some time. \n\nA working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	2277	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	PublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving more room for industrial goods transportation. Also, reduced traffic creates less noise pollution.\n\nBuses, trams, monorails, cable cars, ferries, blimps and metros allow people to travel inside the city. Trains, ships and planes carry tourists in and out of the city. Cargo trains can take goods from an industrial area to a commercial area, drastically reducing the number of trucks on the roads. Cargo harbors allow raw materials and goods to be imported and exported.\n\nTaxi service is particularly useful for tourists, but also for citizens who do not have a car available for use.\n			
3577	2197	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Beautification	0	Decorative elements raise citizen happiness, which is a key element in helping buildings evolve.			
3577	2634	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Monuments	0	Unique Buildings are gained by achieving various things while playing – both positive and negative. Unique Buildings attract tourists into the city.\n\nThere can be only one of each Unique Building built at the same time in your city. Unique Buildings carry over to new game sessions, so after unlocking them, they will be available to you in future cities every time you reach the relevant milestone.\n			
3577	2639	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Wonders	0	Monuments are huge buildings that offer the ultimate solution to certain city services. \n\nMonuments are unlocked by building Unique Buildings and individual Monuments require different combinations of unique buildings to be placed in your city at the same time.\n			
3577	2640	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Policies	0	Policies can be used to affect certain aspects of your city and to add some flavor. If you want to adjust where certain citizen types live, what they can do or what sort of industry is allowed, set policies. \n\nPolicies can be set city-wide or to limited to districts created with the district tool. To set district policies, select a district and then select the policies you want to apply for that district.\n			
3577	2641	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Money	0	You can manage your city's taxes, budget and loans here. The majority of your city's income comes from taxes. Tax income is based on the size and level of the buildings in each of the zones. High taxation will make people unhappy and might cause them to move away. \n\nA bigger budget for a service means its facilities work more efficiently but it also becomes more expensive to maintain. City service budgets can be adjusted separately for day and nighttime from the sliders in the budget view.\n\nYou can take loans from different banks. The loan amount and interest rates differ from bank to bank and there is a limited number of loans that can be taken simultaneously.\n			
3577	2152	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Bulldozer	0	The bulldozer can be used to remove unneeded roads, buildings and other structures. Make sure not to bulldoze anything important.\n\nYou can bulldoze abandoned houses so they don't lower land value around them. Abandoned houses can be re-built later if there's demand for the zone type.\n			
3577	3553	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	HappinessPanel	0	City happiness is key to helping buildings level up into better, less polluting buildings that house more people or employees and pay more taxes. Here you can see what zones need your attention.			
3577	3554	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewsPanel	0	The Info view panel contains multiple buttons for various view modes that help convey information about the different aspects of the city.			
3577	2181	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Default	0	Build roads and zone next to them to allow citizens to move in. Grow the city to unlock more services! \n\nFor help, click on the question mark symbol. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n			
3577	3555	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Welcome	0	Let's start by building some roads and zoning the areas next to them. Buildings will spawn on the zoned areas and you will unlock new city services and buildings as your city grows. \n\nFor help, click on the question mark button. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n			
3577	3556	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	TutorWonders	0	Continue building the city to gain more land to build on and eventually be able to construct a Monument! Monuments are great buildings that benefit the city immensely.			
3577	3557	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewOutsideConnections	0	Outside connections bring in tourists, allow industries to ship goods outside the city and acquire materials for production within the city. The city can be connected to the outside world by roads, rails, ships and airplanes. \n\nThe more options for connections there are, the more profitable businesses become which in turn result in increased tax income.\n			
3577	3558	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDistricts	0	Districts make controlling the way the city develops easy and efficient. There are various district policies and industrial specializations ranging from, for example, the oil industry to minor policies that affect district attractiveness.			
3577	3559	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHappiness	0	When the citizens' needs are catered to and they have jobs and places to go spend their money, they are happy and pay more taxes. Happiness also increases the chance for buildings to level up. \n\nUnemployment, low health and lack of safety cause unhappiness in citizens.\n			
3577	3560	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLandValue	0	Higher level buildings are built only on land that has a high land value. To increase land value, areas need city services and parks or other decorations, and land on shorelines is more valuable by default. Pollution, noise and high crime rate decrease land value.			
3577	3561	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPollution	0	Ground and water pollution is caused by polluting industry, certain power plants and city services, and sewage water if it reaches the shores. Sewage water flows with the currents. \n\nPollution causes sickness in citizens and decreases land value. If the source of pollution is removed, the land will eventually return to its normal, non-polluted state.\n			
3577	3562	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewNoisePollution	0	Noise pollution is caused by industry, traffic and certain city services and monuments. Exposure to noise pollution causes stress in the citizens and reduces their well-being. \n\nYou can decrease the Noise Pollution caused by the traffic by building roads with decoration and sound barriers.\n			
3577	3563	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTrafficCongestion	0	Your citizens travel to enjoy services. If traffic becomes congested, people have a hard time getting to work and back, production slows down when resources and goods sit in trucks, and the effective radius of your service buildings becomes smaller. Larger roads support faster driving and have more lanes. Use roundabouts to help traffic flow better and build new highways to areas with heavy traffic.\n\nUpgrade roads or construct new routes to popular locations if there are many traffic jams. Upgrade highway ramps to highways if they become congested. Relocate service buildings if you cannot change the road type because of them.\n			
3577	3564	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLevel	0	Higher level buildings pay more taxes. To get buildings to level up, make sure people in the city are educated and the land value is high.			
3577	3565	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewAge	0	Seniors and children require more health care than adults and teenagers. Families with children require schools, whereas young adults are more interested in jobs and universities. When people become old, they will eventually pass away and allow new families to move in to the empty apartments.			
3577	2726	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewResources	0	If the map has natural resources available, they can be utilized by allowing industry to specialize in forestry (Forests), oil industry (Oil), ore industry (Ore) or agriculture (Fertile Land). \n\nIf a particular resource is not located on the map, the industry can get it from other cities if you have an outside connection.\n			
3577	3566	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWindSpeed	0	Wind velocity is relevant when placing wind turbines. For optimal electricity output, wind turbines should be placed on locations where the wind is strongest.			
3577	3567	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPopulation	0	High density residential areas house more people and draw in young adults. Low density housing evolves into fancy villas. \n\nHigh density commercial areas consist of shopping malls, restaurant complexes and night clubs, whereas low density commercial has smaller buildings like gas stations, diners and supermarkets.\n			
3577	3568	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving room for industrial goods transportation. Reduced traffic also creates less noise pollution.			
3577	3569	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewElectricity	0	Power plants produce electricity. Electricity moves from building to building, but to carry it over large distances, you must build power lines. \n\nWhen the power line tool is active, you will see an area around buildings that tells you how far electricity reaches. Make your power lines start and end in the marked area. \n\nThe yellow circle around a power plant tells you how far its pollution spreads.\n			
3577	3570	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWater	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes, and draw pipes under your city to provide buildings with water. Note that water pumps and drains also need electricity to work. \n\nMake sure your water pumps are located upstream from the drain pipe to avoid contaminating the water supply.\n			
3577	3571	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEducation	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university. A working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. No matter what their education level is, citizens can always fill vacancies of the same or lower level. Educated workers prefer vacancies that match their education, but will settle for a lower level job eventually, if need be. Filling low level vacancies in a city with a highly educated population can take a while.\n\nWhen placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	3572	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewFireSafety	0	Fires can occur in your city. The fire department building closest to the fire sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected the areas of the city are.			
3577	3573	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewGarbage	0	To collect garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. Garbage handling produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. \n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	3574	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHealth	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars. \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
3577	3575	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewCrime	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime in control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city.			
3577	3576	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEntertainment	0	To raise the happiness of your citizens and land value of areas, leisure locations are needed. Unique buildings, parks and plazas make the area around them more valuable and people happier. When placing any of these buildings, you can see a circle telling you how far the effect will reach.\n\nCitizens and tourists from all over the city visit parks, plazas and unique buildings on their free time.\n

DISASTER_DESC	260	DISASTER_DESC	Tornado	0	A colum of air wreaks destruction on the map. Tornados travel from an edge of the map to another edge. The severity of tornado affect how large the tornado is and how straight it travels through the map. Tornadoes need an entry point.			
3967	263	DISASTER_DESC	Forest Fire	0	Forest fires set nature props and trees on fire. If a forest fire reaches any buildings, it can set them on fire too. A Forest Fire needs a starting point.			
3967	258	DISASTER_DESC	Meteor Strike	0	A flaming rock from space hits the earth. The severity of a Meteor Strike affects how large of a crater will be created and how far from the impact site the destruction reaches. Place disaster to choose impact site.			
3967	256	DISASTER_DESC	Tsunami	0	A wave is created in the sea and travels towards the city. The severity controls the height of the wave. Depending on the map, it can take quite long for the tsunami effect to be seen. The tsunami has no location.			
3967	262	DISASTER_DESC	Earthquake	0	The ground shakes, causing the earth to crack and buildings on cracks to be destroyed. Earthquakes have an epicenter that's the main point of destruction. If the epicenter is on water, the earthquake can cause tsunami like waves.			
3967	259	DISASTER_DESC	Sinkhole	0	Part of the ground suddenly sinks to create a hole. Place disaster to choose location of sinkhole.			
3967	257	DISASTER_DESC	Thunderstorm	0	A powerful storm travels across the map. Lightning bolts can set buildings and forest on fire. A Thunderstorm needs an entry point.			
3967	264	DISASTER_DESC	Structure Fire	0	A structure in the city catches fire. Fire can spread if it's not put out quickly. Fire needs a location with a structure.			
3967	3966	DISASTER_DESC	Structure Collapse	0	A structure in the city collapses. Needs a location with a structure.
