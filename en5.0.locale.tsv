TUTORIAL_ADVISER	153	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Roads	0	Roads need to be built to provide zones for buildings and city services. Larger roads allow faster travel and greater amounts of traffic. This helps service vehicles reach citizens more efficiently. Roads with decoration produce less noise pollution. \n\nUse PageUp and PageDown to build elevated roads or tunnels. Draw a road over water to build a bridge. \n\nTo change the road type, try the upgrading tool: choose a road type and click on an existing road. Click on a one-way road with secondary mouse button to change its direction.\n\nIf you wish to demolish pieces of the highway going through a map tile, you can do it as long as roads from your city connect to the remaining parts.\n	
796	764	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Zoning	0	Zones determine what kinds of buildings will spawn to the areas next to the roads. Areas indicated by a grey grid next to roads can be zoned using zoning tools. \n\nThere are four different tools for zoning: Fill, Marquee and Small and Large Brush. Zone an area by clicking the primary mouse button on it. Hold down the button to adjust the square marquee size or continuously paint with a brush. \n\nResidential zones provide housing for the citizens. Commercial zones offer shopping and leisure opportunities for the citizens and tourists. Industry and office zones provide jobs for the citizens and produce goods for the commercial zones to sell.\n	
796	765	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	District	0	Paint the part of the city you want to become a district. New districts will be named automatically, but can be renamed later by clicking the district's name in its info window. Apply a special policy by selecting it and clicking on the district. Remove districts by painting areas with the secondary mouse button held down. Click on district name to apply policies.\n\nSpecialized industy policies allow industry buildings to be replaced by extractors and specialized production facilities. Extractors produce raw materials and can only appear where a resource exists. Production facilities use natural resources to produce high quality goods. The number of extractors and production facilities is set automatically so the production matches the usage.\n	
796	766	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Electricity	0	Power plants produce electricity for all your modern city's needs. Electricity will move from building to building over short distances, but to transfer electricity over greater distances, you will need to build Power Lines. \n\nWhen placing Power Lines, you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings as a light blue area. Connect these areas with Power Lines to move electricity between them. Power plants produce ground and/or noise pollution. \n\nWhen placing a power plant, the circular area around it tells you how far the pollution spreads.\n	
796	767	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	WaterAndSewage	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes. \n\nDraw the water pipes under your city to provide buildings with fresh water and a sewer system for waste water. Note that the water pumps and drains need electricity to work. \n\nMake sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water. \n	
796	389	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Garbage	0	To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. \n\nWaste management produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes ground pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. Landfill sites and incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash. Make sure they can get around the city easily.\n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	387	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Healthcare	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars. \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	390	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	FireDepartment	0	Fires can occur in your city. To prevent buildings from being destroyed by fire, you need to have a properly equipped fire department in your city. \n\nIn case of fire, the closest fire department building sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected areas in the city are. Depending on the size of the fire, multiple fire engines can be dispatched to put it out.\n\nNote that the burned down buildings need to be bulldozed before new buildings can be built to replace them.\n	
796	391	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Police	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime under control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city, so that patrol cars can respond to calls quickly.\n\nPolice patrols decrease the crime rate. High unemployment and low education increase the crime rate. \n	
796	768	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Government	0	The presence of local government allows for customization of taxes, budget and loans in the city.	
796	388	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Education	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university if one is available. Education is complete when a citizen ends their age phase while enlisted in a school, so educating your population takes some time. \n\nA working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	234	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	PublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving more room for industrial goods transportation. Also, reduced traffic creates less noise pollution. \n\nBuild the infratructure for public transportation and create lines for buses and metros from the relevant public transport submenus.\n\nBuses and metros allow people to travel inside the city. Trains, ships and planes carry tourists in and out of the city. Cargo trains can take goods from an industrial area to a commercial area, drastically reducing the number of trucks on the roads. Cargo harbors allow raw materials and goods to be imported and exported.\n	
796	156	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Beautification	0	You can make your city more attractive and comfortable by building parks, plazas and paths or by planting trees in empty areas. \n\nDecorative elements raise citizen happiness, which is a key element in helping buildings evolve.\n	
796	392	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Monuments	0	Unique Buildings are gained by achieving various things while playing – both positive and negative. Unique Buildings attract tourists into the city.\n\nThere can be only one of each Unique Building built at the same time in your city. Unique Buildings carry over to new game sessions, so after unlocking them, they will be available to you in future cities every time you reach the relevant milestone.\n	
796	306	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Wonders	0	Monuments are huge buildings that offer the ultimate solution to certain city services. \n\nMonuments are unlocked by building Unique Buildings and individual Monuments require different combinations of unique buildings to be placed in your city at the same time.\n	
796	303	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Policies	0	Policies can be used to affect certain aspects of your city and to add some flavor. If you want to adjust where certain citizen types live, what they can do or what sort of industry is allowed, set policies. \n\nPolicies can be set city-wide or to limited to districts created with the district tool. To set district policies, select a district and then select the policies you want to apply for that district.\n	
796	769	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Money	0	You can manage your city's taxes, budget and loans here. The majority of your city's income comes from taxes. Tax income is based on the size and level of the buildings in each of the zones. High taxation will make people unhappy and might cause them to move away. \n\nA bigger budget for a service means its facilities work more efficiently but it is also becomes more expensive to maintain. \n\nYou can take loans from different banks. The loan amount and interest rates differ from bank to bank and there is a limited number of loans that can be taken simultaneously.\n	
796	736	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Bulldozer	0	The bulldozer can be used to remove unneeded roads, buildings and other structures. Make sure not to bulldoze anything important.\n\nYou can bulldoze abandoned houses so they don't lower land value around them. Abandoned houses can be re-built later if there's demand for the zone type.\n	
796	770	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	HappinessPanel	0	City happiness is key to helping buildings level up into better, less polluting buildings that house more people or employees and pay more taxes. Here you can see what zones need your attention.	
796	771	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewsPanel	0	The Info view panel contains multiple buttons for various view modes that help convey information about the different aspects of the city.	
796	772	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Default	0	Build roads and zone next to them to allow citizens to move in. Grow the city to unlock more services! \n\nFor help, click on the question mark symbol. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n	
796	773	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Welcome	0	Let's start by building some roads and zoning the areas next to them. Buildings will spawn on the zoned areas and you will unlock new city services and buildings as your city grows. \n\nFor help, click on the question mark button. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n	
796	774	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	TutorWonders	0	Continue building the city to gain more land to build on and eventually be able to construct a Monument! Monuments are great buildings that benefit the city immensely.	
796	775	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewOutsideConnections	0	Outside connections bring in tourists, allow industries to ship goods outside the city and acquire materials for production within the city. The city can be connected to the outside world by roads, rails, ships and airplanes. \n\nThe more options for connections there are, the more profitable businesses become which in turn result in increased tax income.\n	
796	776	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDistricts	0	Districts make controlling the way the city develops easy and efficient. There are various district policies and industrial specializations ranging from, for example, the oil industry to minor policies that affect district attractiveness.	
796	777	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHappiness	0	When the citizens' needs are catered to and they have jobs and places to go spend their money, they are happy and pay more taxes. Happiness also increases the chance for buildings to level up. \n\nUnemployment, low health and lack of safety cause unhappiness in citizens.\n	
796	778	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLandValue	0	Higher level buildings are built only on land that has a high land value. To increase land value, areas need city services and parks or other decorations. Pollution, noise and high crime rate decrease land value.	
796	779	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPollution	0	Ground and water pollution is caused by polluting industry, certain power plants and city services, and sewage water if it reaches the shores. Sewage water flows with the currents. \n\nPollution causes sickness in citizens and decreases land value. If the source of pollution is removed, the land will eventually return to its normal, non-polluted state.\n	
796	780	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewNoisePollution	0	Noise pollution is caused by industry, traffic and certain city services and monuments. Exposure to noise pollution causes stress in the citizens and reduces their well-being. \n\nYou can decrease the Noise Pollution caused by the traffic by building roads with decoration and sound barriers.\n	
796	781	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTrafficCongestion	0	Your citizens travel to enjoy services. If traffic becomes congested, people have a hard time getting to work and back, production slows down when resources and goods sit in trucks, and the effective radius of your service buildings becomes smaller. Larger roads support faster driving and have more lanes. Use roundabouts to help traffic flow better and build new highways to areas with heavy traffic.\n\nUpgrade roads or construct new routes to popular locations if there are many traffic jams. Upgrade highway ramps to highways if they become congested. Relocate service buildings if you cannot change the road type because of them.\n	
796	782	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLevel	0	Higher level buildings pay more taxes. To get buildings to level up, make sure people in the city are educated and the land value is high.	
796	783	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewAge	0	Seniors and children require more health care than adults and teenagers. Families with children require schools, whereas young adults are more interested in jobs and universities. When people become old, they will eventually pass away and allow new families to move in to the empty apartments.	
796	784	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewResources	0	If the map has natural resources available, they can be utilized by allowing industry to specialize in forestry (Forests), oil industry (Oil), ore industry (Ore) or agriculture (Fertile Land). \n\nIf a particular resource is not located on the map, the industry can get it from other cities if you have an outside connection.\n	
796	785	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWindSpeed	0	Wind velocity is relevant when placing wind turbines. For optimal electricity output, wind turbines should be placed on locations where the wind is strongest.	
796	786	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPopulation	0	High density residential areas house more people and draw in young adults. Low density housing evolves into fancy villas. \n\nHigh density commercial areas consist of shopping malls, restaurant complexes and night clubs, whereas low density commercial has smaller buildings like gas stations, diners and supermarkets.\n	
796	787	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving room for industrial goods transportation. Reduced traffic also creates less noise pollution.	
796	788	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewElectricity	0	Power plants produce electricity. Electricity moves from building to building, but to carry it over large distances, you must build power lines. \n\nWhen the power line tool is active, you will see an area around buildings that tells you how far electricity reaches. Make your power lines start and end in the marked area. \n\nThe yellow circle around a power plant tells you how far its pollution spreads.\n	
796	789	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWater	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes, and draw pipes under your city to provide buildings with water. Note that water pumps and drains also need electricity to work. \n\nMake sure your water pumps are located upstream from the drain pipe to avoid contaminating the water supply.\n	
796	790	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEducation	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university. A working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. No matter what their education level is, citizens can always fill vacancies of the same or lower level. Educated workers prefer vacancies that match their education, but will settle for a lower level job eventually, if need be. Filling low level vacancies in a city with a highly educated population can take a while.\n\nWhen placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	791	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewFireSafety	0	Fires can occur in your city. The fire department building closest to the fire sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected the areas of the city are.	
796	792	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewGarbage	0	To collect garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. Garbage handling produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. \n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	793	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHealth	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars. \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n	
796	794	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewCrime	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime in control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city.	
796	795	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEntertainment	0	To raise the happiness of your citizens and land value of areas, leisure locations are needed. Unique buildings, parks and plazas make the area around them more valuable and people happier. When placing any of these buildings, you can see a circle telling you how far the effect will reach.\n\nCitizens and tourists from all over the city visit parks, plazas and unique buildings on their free time.\n

151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		1	Make your industrial areas connect directly to the highway to allow trucks to move fast and easy to other cities.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		2	Replace the busiest intersections with roundabouts to help traffic flow better.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		3	Running out of fresh water? Use Water Towers to help supply the city.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		4	Citizens living in high level housing pay more taxes than people in low level housing.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		5	To get the highest tax income possible, your city should produce raw materials locally. Specialized industries located at the sites of natural resources produce raw materials.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		6	Industry buildings automatically order raw materials from other cities if none are available locally.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		7	Look at Steam Workshop for user made content for the game!	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		8	Roads full of trucks? Make an elevated road that allows industry areas direct access to an outside highway so trucks don't have to drive through residential areas.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		9	Control trucks by setting a Heavy Traffic Ban policy on areas where you don't want them to go.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		10	Keep an eye on the zone demand bars to see what kind of zoning your citizens crave.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		11	When a building has more than one need icon showing, click on it and hover over the icons in the information window to learn more of what's wrong.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		12	Electricity moves from building to building if they are close to each other.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		13	Always place your Drain Pipes downstream from Water Pumping Stations!	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		14	Raise the budget for a service to make it work more efficiently.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		15	Not happy with the look of a building? Try the Asset Editor and modify it!	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		16	Is it cumbersome to build intersections? Build a few in the Asset Editor and use them in the game as many times as you want.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		17	Educated citizens generate less garbage than uneducated citizens.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		18	Provide services for your industries to allow them to be upgraded to higher level ones. High level industry produces less pollution.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		19	Parks and plazas raise the value of land around them, making citizens happy.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		20	Dams raise and lower water levels. Make sure your Water Pumps still reach the water after the Dam is complete.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		21	Create or log in to a Paradox Account in the main menu to unlock the Paradox Plaza so you can place it in your city.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		22	Relocate buildings to upgrade roads next to them into wider or narrower roads.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		23	If you want to demolish a graveyard or a landfill, it must be emptied first.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		24	Rename a citizen, building, business or almost anything else by clicking on it, then clicking the name in the information window. Type in a new name and press Enter.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		25	Is your highway connection a huge traffic jam? Add a roundabout right after it with roads leading straight to the most popular destinations.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		26	The power production of a Hydro Power Plant depends on the difference in the water level on the different sides of the dam.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		27	Hydro Power Plants need to have a high enough water level to function properly.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		28	Level Up buildings by raising the Land Value and providing education for your citizens.	
151		LOADING_TIP_TEXT		29	Make sure to maintain the Land Value required by the building's level - otherwise the building will get abandoned.
