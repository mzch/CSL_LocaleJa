76	92	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	6	I would much rather see young people read books than play football. Why don't we spend money on that? #subsidizedyouth #football			
76	92	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	7	Why do we waste money on the youth to play football? They can go play in the parks! #subsidizedyouth #football

TUTORIAL_ADVISER	1906	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTerrainHeight	0	Terrain Heights view shows you how high or low terrain is. Avoid building canals from high to low ground, as they can then easily cause flooding.			
1934	1907	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHeating	0	Buildings can use either electricity for heat, or the specific heating services. Heating services are more effective than pure electricity. Heating pipes transfer heat and water to housing.			
1934	1908	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewMaintenance	0	Road Maintenance service boosts roads to allow even higher speeds. Roads with no boost work normally with the maximum speed of their respective road types. Boost fades with time.			
1934	1909	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewSnow	0	When it snows, roads will get covered by snow. This slows down vehicles, making traveling take a longer time than usual. To clear the snow, you need Snow Dumps that send out snow plows. Roads can have different amount of snow on them, depending on when they were plowed and how much it has snowed.			
1934	800	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Landscaping	0	With the landscaping tools, you can lower or elevate terrain, smooth it out or create new hills. When you lower terrain, you will gain soil. When elevating terrain, the same soil is placed on the map. To see how much soil you have, check "Soil available".\n\nWater structures allow you to build canals, quays and flood walls. Canals can be used for beautification or moving water. Use flood walls to keep water in the canal if flooding occurs often. If your canal is not getting any water, try using a deeper canal. You can upgrade canals to be deeper or shallower. Quays are used on water front to finish the shoreline nicely. You can place shoreline buildings on top of quay.\n			
1934	257	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Roads	0	Roads need to be built to provide zones for buildings and city services. Larger roads allow faster travel and greater amounts of traffic. This helps service vehicles reach citizens more efficiently. Roads with decoration produce less noise pollution. \n\nUse PageUp and PageDown to build elevated roads or tunnels. Draw a road over water to build a bridge. \n\nTo change the road type, try the upgrading tool: choose a road type and click on an existing road. Click on a one-way road with secondary mouse button to change its direction.\n\nIf you wish to demolish pieces of the highway going through a map tile, you can do it as long as roads from your city connect to the remaining parts.\n			
1934	807	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Zoning	0	Zones determine what kinds of buildings will spawn to the areas next to the roads. Areas indicated by a grey grid next to roads can be zoned using zoning tools.  \n\nThere are four different tools for zoning: Fill, Marquee and Small and Large Brush. Zone an area by clicking the primary mouse button on it. Hold down the button to adjust the square marquee size or continuously paint with a brush. \n\nResidential zones provide housing for the citizens. Commercial zones offer shopping and leisure opportunities for the citizens and tourists. Industry and office zones provide jobs for the citizens and produce goods for the commercial zones to sell.\n			
1934	808	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	District	0	Paint the part of the city you want to become a district. New districts will be named automatically, but can be renamed later by clicking the district's name in its info window. Apply a special policy by selecting it and clicking on the district. Remove districts by painting areas with the secondary mouse button held down. Click on district name to apply policies.\n\nDistrict specializations allow buildings to be replaced by specialized industrial and commercial facilities. Specialized buildings can benefit from different natural resources or focus on tourism, for example. Specialized industrial and commercial zones are usually more effective in comparison to regular industrial or commercial buildings, but focusing has its downsides that can range from elevated pollutant emissions to increased water consumption.\n			
1934	688	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Electricity	0	Power plants produce electricity for all your modern city's needs. Electricity will move from building to building over short distances, but to transfer electricity over greater distances, you will need to build Power Lines. \n\nWhen placing Power Lines, you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings as a light blue area. Connect these areas with Power Lines to move electricity between them. Power plants produce ground and/or noise pollution. \n\nWhen placing a power plant, the circular area around it tells you how far the pollution spreads.\n			
1934	801	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	WaterAndSewage	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes. Draw the water pipes under your city to provide buildings with fresh water and a sewer system for waste water. Note that the water pumps and drains need electricity to work.\n\nMake sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water.\n\nDuring the winter, heating is required. Upgraded water pipes carry heat to buildings.\n			
1934	687	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Garbage	0	To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. \n\nWaste management produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes ground pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. Landfill sites and incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash. Make sure they can get around the city easily.\n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	802	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Healthcare	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars.  \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	805	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	FireDepartment	0	Fires can occur in your city. To prevent buildings from being destroyed by fire, you need to have a properly equipped fire department in your city. \n\nIn case of fire, the closest fire department building sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected areas in the city are. Depending on the size of the fire, multiple fire engines can be dispatched to put it out.\n\nNote that the burned down buildings need to be bulldozed before new buildings can be built to replace them.\n			
1934	797	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Police	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime under control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city, so that patrol cars can respond to calls quickly.\n\nPolice patrols decrease the crime rate. High unemployment and low education increase the crime rate. \n			
1934	806	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Government	0	The presence of local government allows for customization of taxes, budget and loans in the city.			
1934	803	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Education	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university if one is available. Education is complete when a citizen ends their age phase while enlisted in a school, so educating your population takes some time. \n\nA working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	340	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	PublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving more room for industrial goods transportation. Also, reduced traffic creates less noise pollution.\n\nBuild the infrastructure for public transportation and create lines for buses, trams and metros from the relevant public transport submenus. Taxi service is particularly useful for tourists, but also for citizens who do not have a car available for use.\n\nBuses, trams and metros allow people to travel inside the city. Trains, ships and planes carry tourists in and out of the city. Cargo trains can take goods from an industrial area to a commercial area, drastically reducing the number of trucks on the roads. Cargo harbors allow raw materials and goods to be imported and exported.\n			
1934	260	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Beautification	0	Decorative elements raise citizen happiness, which is a key element in helping buildings evolve.			
1934	804	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Monuments	0	Unique Buildings are gained by achieving various things while playing – both positive and negative. Unique Buildings attract tourists into the city.\n\nThere can be only one of each Unique Building built at the same time in your city. Unique Buildings carry over to new game sessions, so after unlocking them, they will be available to you in future cities every time you reach the relevant milestone.\n			
1934	809	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Wonders	0	Monuments are huge buildings that offer the ultimate solution to certain city services. \n\nMonuments are unlocked by building Unique Buildings and individual Monuments require different combinations of unique buildings to be placed in your city at the same time.\n			
1934	810	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Policies	0	Policies can be used to affect certain aspects of your city and to add some flavor. If you want to adjust where certain citizen types live, what they can do or what sort of industry is allowed, set policies. \n\nPolicies can be set city-wide or to limited to districts created with the district tool. To set district policies, select a district and then select the policies you want to apply for that district.\n			
1934	812	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Money	0	You can manage your city's taxes, budget and loans here. The majority of your city's income comes from taxes. Tax income is based on the size and level of the buildings in each of the zones. High taxation will make people unhappy and might cause them to move away. \n\nA bigger budget for a service means its facilities work more efficiently but it also becomes more expensive to maintain. City service budgets can be adjusted separately for day and nighttime from the sliders in the budget view.\n\nYou can take loans from different banks. The loan amount and interest rates differ from bank to bank and there is a limited number of loans that can be taken simultaneously.\n			
1934	811	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Bulldozer	0	The bulldozer can be used to remove unneeded roads, buildings and other structures. Make sure not to bulldoze anything important.\n\nYou can bulldoze abandoned houses so they don't lower land value around them. Abandoned houses can be re-built later if there's demand for the zone type.\n			
1934	1910	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	HappinessPanel	0	City happiness is key to helping buildings level up into better, less polluting buildings that house more people or employees and pay more taxes. Here you can see what zones need your attention.			
1934	1911	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewsPanel	0	The Info view panel contains multiple buttons for various view modes that help convey information about the different aspects of the city.			
1934	796	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Default	0	Build roads and zone next to them to allow citizens to move in. Grow the city to unlock more services! \n\nFor help, click on the question mark symbol. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n			
1934	1912	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Welcome	0	Let's start by building some roads and zoning the areas next to them. Buildings will spawn on the zoned areas and you will unlock new city services and buildings as your city grows. \n\nFor help, click on the question mark button. It will provide you with information regarding the menu or view you have open.\n			
1934	1913	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	TutorWonders	0	Continue building the city to gain more land to build on and eventually be able to construct a Monument! Monuments are great buildings that benefit the city immensely.			
1934	1914	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewOutsideConnections	0	Outside connections bring in tourists, allow industries to ship goods outside the city and acquire materials for production within the city. The city can be connected to the outside world by roads, rails, ships and airplanes. \n\nThe more options for connections there are, the more profitable businesses become which in turn result in increased tax income.\n			
1934	1915	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDistricts	0	Districts make controlling the way the city develops easy and efficient. There are various district policies and industrial specializations ranging from, for example, the oil industry to minor policies that affect district attractiveness.			
1934	1916	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHappiness	0	When the citizens' needs are catered to and they have jobs and places to go spend their money, they are happy and pay more taxes. Happiness also increases the chance for buildings to level up. \n\nUnemployment, low health and lack of safety cause unhappiness in citizens.\n			
1934	1917	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLandValue	0	Higher level buildings are built only on land that has a high land value. To increase land value, areas need city services and parks or other decorations, and land on shorelines is more valuable by default. Pollution, noise and high crime rate decrease land value.			
1934	1918	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPollution	0	Ground and water pollution is caused by polluting industry, certain power plants and city services, and sewage water if it reaches the shores. Sewage water flows with the currents. \n\nPollution causes sickness in citizens and decreases land value. If the source of pollution is removed, the land will eventually return to its normal, non-polluted state.\n			
1934	1919	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewNoisePollution	0	Noise pollution is caused by industry, traffic and certain city services and monuments. Exposure to noise pollution causes stress in the citizens and reduces their well-being. \n\nYou can decrease the Noise Pollution caused by the traffic by building roads with decoration and sound barriers.\n			
1934	1920	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewTrafficCongestion	0	Your citizens travel to enjoy services. If traffic becomes congested, people have a hard time getting to work and back, production slows down when resources and goods sit in trucks, and the effective radius of your service buildings becomes smaller. Larger roads support faster driving and have more lanes. Use roundabouts to help traffic flow better and build new highways to areas with heavy traffic.\n\nUpgrade roads or construct new routes to popular locations if there are many traffic jams. Upgrade highway ramps to highways if they become congested. Relocate service buildings if you cannot change the road type because of them.\n			
1934	1921	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLevel	0	Higher level buildings pay more taxes. To get buildings to level up, make sure people in the city are educated and the land value is high.			
1934	1922	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewAge	0	Seniors and children require more health care than adults and teenagers. Families with children require schools, whereas young adults are more interested in jobs and universities. When people become old, they will eventually pass away and allow new families to move in to the empty apartments.			
1934	869	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewResources	0	If the map has natural resources available, they can be utilized by allowing industry to specialize in forestry (Forests), oil industry (Oil), ore industry (Ore) or agriculture (Fertile Land). \n\nIf a particular resource is not located on the map, the industry can get it from other cities if you have an outside connection.\n			
1934	1923	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWindSpeed	0	Wind velocity is relevant when placing wind turbines. For optimal electricity output, wind turbines should be placed on locations where the wind is strongest.			
1934	1924	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPopulation	0	High density residential areas house more people and draw in young adults. Low density housing evolves into fancy villas. \n\nHigh density commercial areas consist of shopping malls, restaurant complexes and night clubs, whereas low density commercial has smaller buildings like gas stations, diners and supermarkets.\n			
1934	1925	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPublicTransport	0	Public transportation helps decrease the number of private vehicles on the roads, leaving room for industrial goods transportation. Reduced traffic also creates less noise pollution.			
1934	1926	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewElectricity	0	Power plants produce electricity. Electricity moves from building to building, but to carry it over large distances, you must build power lines. \n\nWhen the power line tool is active, you will see an area around buildings that tells you how far electricity reaches. Make your power lines start and end in the marked area. \n\nThe yellow circle around a power plant tells you how far its pollution spreads.\n			
1934	1927	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewWater	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes, and draw pipes under your city to provide buildings with water. Note that water pumps and drains also need electricity to work. \n\nMake sure your water pumps are located upstream from the drain pipe to avoid contaminating the water supply.\n			
1934	1928	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEducation	0	Children need elementary schools, teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university. A working school system produces educated adults who can fill high level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. No matter what their education level is, citizens can always fill vacancies of the same or lower level. Educated workers prefer vacancies that match their education, but will settle for a lower level job eventually, if need be. Filling low level vacancies in a city with a highly educated population can take a while.\n\nWhen placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	1929	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewFireSafety	0	Fires can occur in your city. The fire department building closest to the fire sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected the areas of the city are.			
1934	1930	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewGarbage	0	To collect garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. Garbage handling produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. \n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	1931	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHealth	0	To keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough health care facilities and that the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime and contaminated water reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, but patients can also arrive using their own cars. \n\nYour citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a Cemetery in the city to bury them in. \n\nCemeteries and Crematoriums take care of the deceased by sending out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
1934	1932	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewCrime	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime in control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city.			
1934	1933	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewEntertainment	0	To raise the happiness of your citizens and land value of areas, leisure locations are needed. Unique buildings, parks and plazas make the area around them more valuable and people happier. When placing any of these buildings, you can see a circle telling you how far the effect will reach.\n\nCitizens and tourists from all over the city visit parks, plazas and unique buildings on their free time.\n
