133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	2	Oh no, I don't think my hamster was found after the disaster, and when I went to look, there was already a new house on the lot! #fastrecovery #savethehamster			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	3	I hate seeing destroyed buildings, they just cramp up the city feng shui. Thanks for #fastrecovery			
133	161	CHIRP_POLICY	FastRecovery	4	Look at those new buildings, so shiny and they were built so fast! #fastrecovery			
133	162	CHIRP_POLICY	NoRebuild	0	As an urban explorer, I simply love that the city has preserved some of the ruins. They are exciting! #norebuild

133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	9	If only I could see the educational posters also when riding a blimp! #dreamer #educationalblimps			
133	164	CHIRP_POLICY	EducationalBlimps	10	I want to place an advert on a blimp but these educational posters are taking up all the space! #annoyed #educationalblimps			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	0	The tickets are so expensive! I might be better off just buying my own car. #carshopping #highticketprices			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	1	I feel the ticket prices are a bit high, but it’s justified. The system is wonderful! #highticketprices			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	2	I don’t mind paying a high price for public transport tickets, it’s not like I’m poor! #cashmoney #plentyofdough #highticketprices			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	3	I have plenty of money, right? So I can pay the ticket prices. After that I don’t have plenty of money #emptypockets #highticketprices			
133	165	CHIRP_POLICY	HighTicketPrices	4	It’s so expensive to use the public transport! I have to walk tomorrow! #myownway #highticketprices

133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	2	I heard that if you do not recycle your plastic waste, #penguins will die. 			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	3	About the time we had better #plastic #recycling system in the city. 			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	4	In the U.S. alone, 2,5 million #plastic bottles are thrown out every hour! #Recycle and #Reuse. 			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	5	Great news: Local #businesses join the plastic #recycling effort 			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	6	You can probably #recycle more than you think. Just pay attention to what you put in the #trash. 			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	7	#plastic #pollution is getting worse, we must save the Earth. #makeEarthgreatagain			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	8	We are filling our oceans and lands with plastics. #recycle !			
133	166	CHIRP_POLICY	RecyclePlastic	9	We wouldn't have to recycle our #plastic bags, bottles, etc if we ceased to manufacture them. Why won't we?

133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	4	Every car that is not polluting the atmosphere is a good car. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	5	Oh nice. I just bought a new #car and now I can't use it? Really? #engineban			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	6	This #combustion #engine #ban will kill all the businesses in the area. I'm sure about it. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	7	I find this new combustion engine ban a very welcome reform. People should walk more anyway. 			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	8	Yes! Great to see that the city officials are all for the greener future. Good job! #combustionengineban			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	9	Global warming is fake news, so these kind of bans make no sense #makeourcitygreatagain			
133	167	CHIRP_POLICY	CombustionEngineBan	10	I don't mind having less #traffic and more room for #bicycles :D #combustionengineban			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	0	Hey, where's all the traffic noise gone! #electric #cars are so silent it's amazing.			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	1	Electric cars are dangerous as people cannot hear the electric cars coming! Think about that.			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	2	Was there a new Edison #electriccar model coming out this year? 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	3	Have you noticed the new recharge stations for electric cars? #EVSE

133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	5	I didn't know electric cars are as fast as they are :o 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	6	Electric or hybrid? What's your opinion? #electriccars			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	7	I've been very satisfied with the new electric car. I was a bit biased, but now I wouldn't change back to a traditional car. 			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	8	Is it possible to modify your old car into an #electriccar or #hybrid? I wouldn't want to change my trusty old car. It has served me 30 years already.			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	9	Electric cars - what are they good for? Meh. #monstertrucks4ever			
133	168	CHIRP_POLICY	ElectricCars	10	A bold move from our city to move away from the conventional fossil #fuelvehicles. #ElectricCars are the future!

133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	2	Reducing industrial waste is the right choice. Makes living in the city much nicer too. 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	3	let me tell ya: I know what's it like to work in a factory. This waste filtering thing is good for the workers too. 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	4	Is this again some kind of #globalwarming #scheme? They are just trying to sell those expensive filters for everyone. 			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	5	How do the #industrial #waste #filters work? Do they plug those in the waste pipes and that's it?			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	6	I'm thinking if it would be possible to still filter the filtered waste...? #justwondering			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	7	Awesome! This is great news. Less pollution = Green revolution #industrial #waste #filtering			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	8	Enforcing the industrial waste regulations was a good move - then again, what other choice do we have #pollution #globalwarming			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	9	I will happily pay some extra taxes, if we can get the industrial waste levels down.			
133	169	CHIRP_POLICY	FilterIndustrialWaste	10	Has anybody thought how must it produces waste to make those industrial waste filters? yeah, let that sink in for a bit... #theuglytruth #globalwarminghoax #flatearthfacts			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	0	Good bye monopoly of the energy companies! Self-sufficient houses are going to change the game. #offthegrid			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	1	#Ecological does not equal uneconomical. Many of the modern #ecofriendly solutions are comfortable and relatively affordable.

133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	3	Eco this and eco that. What's the whole fuss about some global warming? Same weather every year where I live. #ecocritical #localwarming			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	4	Decentralizing energy production and waste management should have more support. That is the solution of future anyway. 			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	5	If you want to live like the pioneers, go live in the woods, hippies! 			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	6	Self-sufficient… more like in-sufficient for me XD IMHO #powerconsumer #supercharged #singleservingsonly			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	7	I think everyone should handle their own power, water and waste so they would learn to regulate their usage better. #responsibleliving			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	8	Just to be clear: people lived without electricity and had outhouses longtime ago, but self-sufficient houses are a totally different thing.			
133	170	CHIRP_POLICY	Selfsufficient	9	Where to buy solar panels with best value for the money? Any #protip s?

133	209	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	5	Football can't be good for you! All that running around gives me a headache. #subsidizedyouth #football			
133	209	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	6	I would much rather see young people read books than play football. Why don't we spend money on that? #subsidizedyouth #football			
133	209	CHIRP_POLICY	SubsidizedYouth	7	Why do we waste money on the youth to play football? They can go play in the parks! #subsidizedyouth #football

133	211	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	4	More police = better #matchsecurity #football			
133	211	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	5	Why are we wasting money on extra police on match days? I think homeless sloths are much more in need of help than football fans! #matchsecurity #football			
133	211	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	6	Football fans should take better care of their belongings and keep their heads cool! No extra police would be needed! #matchsecurity #football			
133	211	CHIRP_POLICY	MatchSecurity	7	Do we really need more police on match days? Maybe that money could be better spent on others things, like libraries #matchsecurity #football

Canals can be used for beautification or moving water. Use flood walls to keep water in the canal if flooding occurs often. If your canal is not getting any water, try using a deeper canal. You can upgrade canals to be deeper or shallower. Quays are used on water front to finish the shoreline nicely. You can place shoreline buildings on top of quay.\n\nTrees, rocks and cliffs can be placed on the map for added flavor and aesthetical purposes. Trees also reduce Noise Pollution in their vicinity. To replace trees on a road, click on the road while having a tree selected.\n

4495	3669	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Electricity	0	Power plants produce electricity for all your modern city's needs. Electricity will move from building to building over short distances, but to transfer electricity over greater distances, you will need to build Power Lines. \n\nWhen placing Power Lines, you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings as a light blue area. Connect these areas with Power Lines to move electricity between them. Power plants produce ground and/or noise pollution. \n\nWhen placing a power plant, the circular area around it tells you how far the pollution spreads.\n			
4495	3871	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	WaterAndSewage	0	Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes. Draw the water pipes under your city to provide buildings with a water and a sewer system.

Water Tanks store excess water and supply the city automatically when demand exceeds production.\n\nMake sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water.\n\nDuring the winter, heating is required. Upgraded water pipes carry heat to buildings.\n			
4495	3668	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Garbage	0	To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. \n\nWaste management produces pollution, so the facilities should be placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes ground pollution over time, so make sure you have enough garbage facilities. Landfill sites and incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash. Make sure they can get around the city easily.\n\nGood connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.\n			
4495	3872	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Healthcare	0	To keep citizens healthy, make sure they have access to enough healthcare facilities via good road connections. Pollution, crime and contaminated water all affect the health of the citizens.

Deathcare buildings send out hearses to pick up the deceased. When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve effectively.\n\nChild Health Centre increases the birth rate within the building's radius and offers health services to minors. Eldercare treats the elderly, increasing and varying the citizen lifespan within the building radius. \n			
4495	3875	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	FireDepartment	0	Fires can occur in your city. To prevent buildings from being destroyed by fire, you need to have a properly equipped fire department in your city. \n\nIn case of fire, the closest fire department building sends out a fire truck to help, but how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of roads and how well connected areas in the city are. Depending on the size of the fire, multiple fire engines can be dispatched to put it out.\n\nHelicopters can reach destinations with no road access, and are the only way to extinguish forest fires. Build Firewatch Towers to spot forest fires early.\n			
4495	3855	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	Police	0	Police patrol the city to keep crime under control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings have good connections to the city, so that patrol cars can respond to calls quickly.

The city can be connected to the outside world by roads, rails, ships and airplanes. \n\nThe more options for connections there are, the more profitable businesses become which in turn result in increased tax income.\n			
4495	4476	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewDistricts	0	Districts make controlling the way the city develops easy and efficient. There are various district policies and industrial specializations ranging from, for example, the oil industry to minor policies that affect district attractiveness.			
4495	4477	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewHappiness	0	When the citizens' needs are catered to and they have jobs and places to go spend their money, they are happy and pay more taxes. Happiness also increases the chance for buildings to level up. \n\nUnemployment, low health and lack of safety cause unhappiness in citizens.\n			
4495	4478	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewLandValue	0	Higher level buildings are built only on land that has a high land value. To increase land value, areas need city services and parks or other decorations, and land on shorelines is more valuable by default. Pollution, noise and high crime rate decrease land value.			
4495	4479	TUTORIAL_ADVISER	InfoViewPollution	0	Ground and water pollution is caused by polluting industry, certain power plants and city services, and sewage water if it reaches the shores.

DISASTER_DESC	310	DISASTER_DESC	Tornado	0	A colum of air wreaks destruction on the map. Tornados travel from an edge of the map to another edge. The severity of tornado affect how large the tornado is and how straight it travels through the map. Tornadoes need an entry point.			
5687	313	DISASTER_DESC	Forest Fire	0	Forest fires set nature props and trees on fire. If a forest fire reaches any buildings, it can set them on fire too. A Forest Fire needs a starting point.			
5687	308	DISASTER_DESC	Meteor Strike	0	A flaming rock from space hits the earth. The severity of a Meteor Strike affects how large of a crater will be created and how far from the impact site the destruction reaches. Place disaster to choose impact site.			
5687	306	DISASTER_DESC	Tsunami	0	A wave is created in the sea and travels towards the city. The severity controls the height of the wave. Depending on the map, it can take quite long for the tsunami effect to be seen. The tsunami has no location.			
5687	312	DISASTER_DESC	Earthquake	0	The ground shakes, causing the earth to crack and buildings on cracks to be destroyed. Earthquakes have an epicenter that's the main point of destruction. If the epicenter is on water, the earthquake can cause tsunami like waves.			
5687	309	DISASTER_DESC	Sinkhole	0	Part of the ground suddenly sinks to create a hole. Place disaster to choose location of sinkhole.			
5687	307	DISASTER_DESC	Thunderstorm	0	A powerful storm travels across the map. Lightning bolts can set buildings and forest on fire. A Thunderstorm needs an entry point.			
5687	314	DISASTER_DESC	Structure Fire	0	A structure in the city catches fire. Fire can spread if it's not put out quickly. Fire needs a location with a structure.			
5687	5686	DISASTER_DESC	Structure Collapse	0	A structure in the city collapses. Needs a location with a structure.
